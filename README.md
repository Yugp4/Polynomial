# Polynomial
Create a polynomial expression do basic operations on that expression

-------------------CODED IN JAVA----------------

This program accepts only a polynomial expression input and returns a returns the expression as a polynomial form.  This program also has 2 additional features that could performed with the polynomials.

First feature: ADD.  This feature adds two polynomials and returns their result as one polynomial.

Second feature: MULTIPLY.  This feature multiplies two polynomials returns their result as one polynomial.

Third feature: EVALUATE.  This feature evaluates the polynomial at a certain value and returns the result at the value.

A driver application file has been provided called "Polytest.java" which is not created by me, but provided to me by my professor, and accepts inputs as follows:

First, in order to represent a polynomial function, create a text file as follows:

The entries should be entered with the first number being a coeffiecient followed by the degree.

(Note: all entries should be added in descending order of degrees and negative degrees aren't allowed but negative coefficients are)

Valid example:

4 5

-3 4

10 3

111 2

1 1

55 0

These values represent the polynomial: 4x^5 - 3x^4 + 10x^3 + 111x^2 + x + 55

Invalid example: 

3 3

4 5

7 2

Invalid example:

4 2

3 0

1 -1

3 -2

After the files have been created with the correct format as shown above the functions can be performed
